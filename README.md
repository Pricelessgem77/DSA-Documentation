# DSA-Documentation
Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio. I specialize in turning raw data into actionable insights that drive decision-making. With a strong foundation in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization, I use tools like SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau/Power BI to uncover patterns and solve real-world business problems.
