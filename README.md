This where i started my portfolio building while  taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub.

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from MS Excel to SQL and now to my portfolio building.

## Project Topic: Aspiring Data Analysis 
I am a dedicated and enthusiastic data analysis student with a strong foundation in statistical analysis, data manipulation, and visualization. My journey into data began with a fascination for uncovering hidden patterns and transforming raw numbers into actionable intelligence.

I thrive on solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches. My core strengths include proficiency in SQL for database management, and hands-on experience with visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI. I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and contribute to impactful projects.I am eager to apply my analytical abilities in a dynamic team environment.
